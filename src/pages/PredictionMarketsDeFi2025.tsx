                  This is not hypothetical. Prediction markets have existed for decades, but decentralized versions built on blockchain technology are now demonstrating their power at unprecedented scale. In this guide, we will explain what prediction markets are, how Polymarket became a billion-dollar platform, and why this technology matters for information discovery beyond politics.

                  <strong className="text-foreground">A prediction market is a platform where participants trade on the outcomes of future events.</strong> Instead of betting on sports or casino games, users trade contracts that pay out based on whether a specific event occurs. The price of these contracts reflects the market's collective probability assessment.

                    Polymarket's election markets consistently provided probability assessments that differed significantly from traditional polling aggregates.

According to data from Polymarket and Bloomberg coverage, the platform processed over $3.5 billion in election-related volume.

                      When traders must stake real money on their predictions, biases become expensive. Wishful thinking, political loyalty, and overconfidence all cost money in prediction markets.

                  As infrastructure improves and regulatory clarity emerges, prediction markets are likely to expand into corporate decision-making, scientific research, and policy analysis. The 2024 election cycle demonstrated that when millions of dollars are at stake, crowd forecasting can outperform traditional information sources.
