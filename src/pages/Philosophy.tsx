                Financial awareness is not just about making money. It is about understanding how systems work
                so you can make choices, not just follow rules. DeFi gives individuals a chance to reclaim that control.
                Here, we teach you how, step by step.

                For too long, traditional financial institutions have programmed us to believe
                that true financial freedom is impossible. They have conditioned us to accept
                middlemen, hidden fees, and systems designed to extract value from our labor.
                It is time to break free from this conditioning and reprogram our understanding
                of what money and finance truly represent.
