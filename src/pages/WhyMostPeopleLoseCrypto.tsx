                    The crypto markets have created generational wealth for some and devastating losses for others. According to multiple studies, an estimated <strong className="text-foreground">70-90% of retail traders lose money</strong> in cryptocurrency markets. This is not because crypto is inherently broken. It is because human psychology and centralized systems create predictable failure patterns.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-foreground/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    Understanding these patterns is the first step toward avoiding them. Let's examine why most people lose, what the 2022 CeFi collapse revealed about centralized risk, and how DeFi's structural advantages offer a fundamentally different approach.

                  <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Research from the Bank for International Settlements found that <strong className="text-foreground">75% of retail crypto investors lost money</strong> between 2015 and 2022. A separate analysis by the National Bureau of Economic Research showed similar results: the majority of retail participants in crypto markets exit with less than they entered.

                  <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    These numbers are not unique to crypto. They mirror statistics from forex, options, and other speculative markets. The common denominator is not the asset class. It is human behavior.

                  <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                    Most people approach crypto as a get-rich-quick opportunity rather than a technology shift requiring education and discipline. This mindset creates the conditions for failure before a single trade is placed.

                      <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                        Fear of missing out drives people to buy when prices are highest and headlines are loudest. Bitcoin's all-time highs in 2017, 2021, and subsequent peaks all saw massive retail inflows, right before significant corrections. Buying based on excitement rather than analysis is the most common mistake.
                      </p>
                    </div>

                      <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                        The flip side of FOMO is panic. When markets drop 30%, 50%, or more, emotional investors sell at the bottom, crystallizing losses that would have recovered with patience. Data shows that Bitcoin holders who maintained positions through any 4-year period have historically seen positive returns, yet most people sell during drawdowns.

                      <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                        The allure of 1000x returns leads people into speculative tokens with no fundamentals. While rare winners make headlines, the vast majority of meme coins and "shitcoins" go to zero. Research from Chainalysis shows that over 90% of new tokens launched lose significant value within 12 months.

                      <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                        Active trading sounds sophisticated but usually destroys returns. Transaction fees, taxes, and the impossibility of consistently timing markets erode portfolios. Studies show that buy-and-hold strategies outperform active trading for the vast majority of participants across all asset classes.

                      <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                        Many investors allocate far more capital than they can afford to lose, use excessive leverage, or fail to diversify. When inevitable downturns occur, poor risk management turns temporary drawdowns into permanent capital destruction.

                    Beyond individual behavioral mistakes, 2022 exposed catastrophic failures in centralized crypto infrastructure. These were not market corrections. They were institutional failures that destroyed customer funds.

                    According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and Galaxy Research, these failures shared common characteristics: <strong className="text-foreground">opaque balance sheets, commingled customer funds, inadequate risk management, and lack of transparency</strong>.

                  <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                    Users trusted centralized entities with custody of their assets, and that trust was betrayed. The lesson: centralization introduces counterparty risk that no amount of due diligence can fully eliminate.
